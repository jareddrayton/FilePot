Limitations

For TVDB only at the moment.
Only for episodes in seasons. No specials or OVAs

Check the source folder for total number of episodes and that it equals the total number of episodes contained in a season.

Scenario 1 

Episodes are in one directiory with incremental numbering naming.

1	 1.1
2	 1.2
3	 1.3
4	 2.1
5	 2.2
6	 2.3

Scenario 2 

Episodes are in a correct season directory structure but have a global incremental numbering rather than local to the season.

1.1  1.1
1.2  1.2 
1.3  1.3
2.4  2.1
2.5  2.2 
2.6  2.3



Basic functionality.

Set the source folder containing files for renaming.
We'll have to match to the correct target show/ID from TVDB. (Can be manually to start with)

Verify that we have the correct number of episodes:-
Get seasons using GET /series/{id}/episodes/summary




Preview of name change.
Then a commit to change. 

Each file has to be renamed AND moved into a new directory
