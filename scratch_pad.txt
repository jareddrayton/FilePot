Limitations

For TVDB only at the moment.
Only for episodes in seasons. No specials or OVAs

Check the source folder for total number of episodes and that it  equals the total number of episodes contained in a season.

Scenario 1 

Assume all episodes are in root directory.

1	 1.1
2	 1.2
3	 1.3
4	 2.1
5	 2.2
6	 2.3

Scenario 2 

1.1  1.1
1.2  1.2 
1.3  1.3
2.4  2.1
2.5  2.2 
2.6  2.3



Basic functionality.

Set the source folder containing files for renaming.
We'll have to match to the correct target show/ID from TVDB. (Can be manually to start with)

Verify that We have correct number of episodes:-
Get seasons using GET /series/{id}/episodes/summary




Preview of name change.
Then a commit to change.
